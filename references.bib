  abstract   = {We revisit Smullyan's paper ``Truth and Provability'' for three purposes. First, we introduce the notion of Smullyan models to give a precise definition for Smullyan's framework discussed in that paper. Second, we clarify the relationship between Theorems F, T, and G proved by Smullyan and other newly introduced properties for Smullyan models in terms of both implications and non-implications. Third, we construct two Smullyan models based on arithmetic and show the correspondence between the properties of these Smullyan models and those concerning truth and provability in arithmetic.},
